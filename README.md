# Front-end Project 🌌

### **Welcome to Front-end Project - Where Front-end Magic Happens!** 🚀

#### 📜 **Description:**
Explore a web application that unleashes the power to create HTTP requests and dissect their responses, including detailed URL analysis. All your requests and their responses are securely stored in a database, waiting to be explored through a dedicated page accessible via request IDs.

#### 🔍 **Details:**
Here's what our homepage looks like after you've submitted the information via the form:

- At the top, you'll find the HTTP request's status code.
- Just below, there's a concise description of the status code.
- In the center of the page, an input field is flanked by a select dropdown with various HTTP methods on the left and a submit button on the right.
- Further down, three blocks await you. The first one showcases details about the entered URL, while the other two provide insights for each HTTP request. In a specific example, an HTTP request to the entered URL resulted in a 302 redirect, hence you'll find two request blocks.
- Finally, a link directs you to a page with comprehensive information about the recently submitted request.
